When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? As a backup, or when sharing with other contributors

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? You might not want to add all changes to your local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? Branches are extensions to master branch, clones are copies locally or from remote, forks are GitHub server clones

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? To see and stay up to date with changes

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder? I think I could use google docs, or just meet in person. GitHub is probably easier for some applications and you can't always meet in person.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? If you were trying a test version of the code, or another language. What benefits does each approach have? Adding changes directly to master is faster, and less complicated. Adding changes to a branch gives you more freedom.
