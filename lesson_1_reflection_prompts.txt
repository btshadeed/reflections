1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

Being able to see the lines next each other made the typo stand out.



2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

    
Seeing the progression, and older versions of a file would help in not repeating mistakes, as well as a record of solutions
to problems.


3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
 automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    

Having to manually save allows you the freedow to choose when a commit is necessary. Choosing too many, not enough commits 
make it hard to read.

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google
 Docs, treat each file separately?

    
Allowing multi-file single commits saves time.


5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    
With Git Bash


6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?

    
Version control allows you to see/review the effects of each change to the file.


7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    
To rule the world!!! MUuhaahahaha!
